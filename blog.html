<h3>Assignment 1: Starting Out</h3>
<p>This first assignment was relatively easy once I figured out how to find a coding environment that works well with HTML and web development. The coding itself was relatively easy once I figure dout how the syntax and structure of the code would work best for me. Online resources were very helpful in this case when I was just starting as it gave me a solid place to begin and to understand the code. I am still playing around with different coding envrionements to see what works best for my style of coding but other than that I beleieve I have a general grasp on the beginning of HTML and web development.</p>

<h3>Assignment 1: What Did I learn?</h3>
<p>I learned quite a bit about HTML in this first assignment and found it to be really enjoyable once you get it working. I understand now how the syntax works and its really interesting to see progress almost immediately.This first assignment really interested me in learning more about web development and hopefully this feeling will continue through the class.</p>
